Gitlet is a miniature version control system inspired by Git, designed to replicate some of the basic features of the Git software. This project is part of the coursework from CS61B Data Structures course, aiming to demonstrate an understanding of the concepts behind Git and to explore Java's file system manipulation capabilities.
